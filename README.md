Configure a RHEL 7 system to be DISA STIG compliant.
Non-disruptive CAT I, CAT II, and CAT III findings will be corrected by default.
Disruptive finding remediation can be enabled by setting `rhel7stig_disruption_high` to `true`.

## Caution(s)

This role **will make changes to the system** which may have unintended consequences. This is not an auditing tool but rather a remediation tool to be used after an audit has been conducted.

Check Mode is not supported! The role will complete in check mode without errors, but it is not supported and should be used with caution. The RHEL7-STIG-Audit role or a compliance scanner should be used for compliance checking over check mode.

This role was developed against a clean install of the Operating System. If you are implementing to an existing system please review this role for any site specific changes that are needed.

To use release version please point to main branch and relevant release for the cis benchmark you wish to work with.

---

## Updating

Coming from a previous release.

As with all releases and updates, It is suggested to test and align controls.
This contains rewrites and ID reference changes as per STIG documentation.

- The password hash
  - If adopting grub password has to be supplied and variables updated.
  - It no longer tries to create the hash.

More information can be found in the [ChangeLog](./ChangeLog.md)

## Auditing (new)

This can be turned on or off within the defaults/main.yml file with the variable run_audit. The value is false by default, please refer to the wiki for more details.

This is a much quicker, very lightweight, checking (where possible) config compliance and live/running settings.

A new form of auditing has been develeoped, by using a small (12MB) go binary called [goss](https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss) along with the relevant configurations to check. Without the need for infrastructure or other tooling.
This audit will not only check the config has the correct setting but aims to capture if it is running with that configuration also trying to remove [false positives](https://www.mindpointgroup.com/blog/is-compliance-scanning-still-relevant/) in the process.

Refer to

- [RHEL7-STIG-Audit](https://github.com/ansible-lockdown/RHEL7-STIG-Audit).

## Documentation

- [Read The Docs](https://ansible-lockdown.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Getting Started](https://www.lockdownenterprise.com/docs/getting-started-with-lockdown#GH_AL_RH7_stig)
- [Customizing Roles](https://www.lockdownenterprise.com/docs/customizing-lockdown-enterprise#GH_AL_RH7_stig)
- [Per-Host Configuration](https://www.lockdownenterprise.com/docs/per-host-lockdown-enterprise-configuration#GH_AL_RH7_stig)
- [Getting the Most Out of the Role](https://www.lockdownenterprise.com/docs/get-the-most-out-of-lockdown-enterprise#GH_AL_RH7_stig)

## Requirements

RHEL 7 or CentOS 7 - Other versions are not supported.
Access to download or add the goss binary and content to the system if using auditing. options are available on how to get the content to the system.

## Dependencies

The following packages must be installed on the controlling host/host where ansible is executed:

- Python3 (preferred)
- Ansible 2.9+
- python2-passlib (or just passlib, if using python3)
- python-lxml
- python-xmltodict
- python-jmespath

Package 'python-xmltodict' is required if you enable the OpenSCAP tool installation and run a report. Packages python(2)-passlib and python-jmespath are required for tasks with custom filters or modules. These are all required on the controller host that executes Ansible.

## Role Variables

This role is designed that the end user should not have to edit the tasks themselves. All customizing should be done via the defaults/main.yml file or with extra vars within the project, job, workflow, etc.

### Tags

There are many tags available for added control precision. Each control has it's own set of tags noting the control number as well as what parts of the system that control addresses.

Below is an example of the tag section from a control within this role. Using this example if you set your run to skip all controls with the tag dconf, this task will be skipped. The opposite can also happen where you run only controls tagged with dconf.

```sh
tags:
      - RHEL-07-010060
      - CAT2
      - CCI-000056
      - SRG-OS-000028-GPOS-00009
      - SV-204396r880746_rule
      - V-204396
      - dconf
```

## Example Audit Summary

This is based on a vagrant image with selections enabled. e.g. No Gui iptables firewall

Note: More tests are run during audit as we check config and running state.

```sh
ok: [cent7_bios] => {
    "msg": [
        "The pre remediation results are: Count: 505, Failed: 214, Duration: 14.808s.",
        "The post remediation results are: Count: 505, Failed: 34, Duration: 43.593s.",
        "Full breakdown can be found in /opt",
        ""
    ]
}
  ]
}

## Branches

- **devel** - This is the default branch and the working development branch. Community pull requests will pull into this branch
- **main** - This is the release branch
- **reports** - This is a protected branch for our scoring reports, no code should ever go here
- **gh_pages** - github pages
- **all other branches** - Individual community member branches

## Containers - Testing

- system_is_container

This is set to false by defaults/main.yml
If discovered it is a container type or ansible_connection == docker it will convert to run to with with true.
Some controls will skip is this is true as they are not applicable at all. Others runs a subset of controls found in vars/is_container.yml based on a vendor supplied un altered image.

**NON altered vendor image.**

- container_vars_file: is_container.yml

This vars file runs controls are grouped into tags so if the container does later have ssh it could be re-enabled by loading an alternative vars file.

### Please Be Aware

- This does set the single user password for grub this does need to be defined - You can create the hash on a RHEL 7.9 system using the command 'grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2'
- Some controls make changes to sudo, please ensure a sudo password is set for the user and it is added to the way to run your playbook.

## Community Contribution

We encourage you (the community) to contribute to this role. Please read the rules below.

- Once your changes are merged and a more detailed review is complete, an authorized member will merge your changes into the main branch for a new release.

## Pipeline Testing

uses:

- ansible-core 2.12
- ansible collections - pulls in the latest version based on requirements file
- runs the audit using the devel branch
- This is an automated test that occurs on pull requests into devel

## Known Issues

None
